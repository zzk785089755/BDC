> **Abstract:** *Existing 3D occupancy networks demand significant hardware resources, hindering the deployment of edge devices. Binarized Neural Networks (BNN) offer substantially reduced computational and memory requirements. However, their performance decreases notably compared to full-precision networks. Moreover, it is challenging to enhance the performance of binarized models by increasing the number of binarized convolutional layers, which limits their practicability for 3D occupancy prediction. To bridge these gaps, we propose a novel binarized deep convolution (BDC) unit that effectively enhances performance while increasing the number of binarized convolutional layers. Firstly, through theoretical analysis, we demonstrate that 1 Ã— 1 binarized convolutions introduce minimal binarization errors. Therefore, additional binarized convolutional layers are constrained to 1 Ã— 1 in the BDC unit. Secondly, we introduce the per-channel weight branch to mitigate the impact of binarization errors from unimportant channel features on the performance of binarized models, thereby improving performance while increasing the number of binarized convolutional layers. Furthermore, we decompose the 3D occupancy network into four convolutional modules and utilize the proposed BDC unit to binarize these modules. Our BDC-Occ model is created by applying the proposed BDC unit to binarize the existing 3D occupancy networks. Comprehensive quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate that the proposed BDC-Occ is the state-of-the-art binarized 3D occupancy network algorithm.*
